class Square(object):
    """
    This is an example of a module level function.

    Function parameters should be documented in the ``Args`` section. The name
    of each parameter is required. The type and description of each parameter
    is optional, but should be included if not obvious.

    they should be listed as ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``.

    The format for a parameter is::

        name (type): description
            The description may span multiple lines. Following
            lines should be indented. The "(type)" is optional.

            Multiple paragraphs are supported in parameter
            descriptions.

    Args:
        param1 (int): The first parameter.
        param2 (:obj:`str`, optional): The second parameter. Defaults to None.
            Second line of description should be indented.
        *args: Variable length argument list.
        **kwargs: Arbitrary keyword arguments.

    Returns:
        bool: True if successful, False otherwise.

        The return type is optional and may be specified at the beginning of
        the ``Returns`` section followed by a colon.

        The ``Returns`` section may span multiple lines and paragraphs.
        Following lines should be indented to match the first line.

        The ``Returns`` section supports any reStructuredText formatting,
        including literal blocks::

            {
                'param1': param1,
                'param2': param2
            }

    Raises:
        AttributeError: The ``Raises`` section is a list of all exceptions
            that are relevant to the interface.
        ValueError: If `param2` is equal to `param1`.

    """
    def __init__(self):
        """
        Example of docstring on the __init__ method.

        The __init__ method may be documented in either the class level
        docstring, or as a docstring on the __init__ method itself.

        Either form is acceptable, but the two should not be mixed. Choose one
        convention to document the __init__ method and be consistent with it.

        Note:
            Do not include the `self` parameter in the ``Args`` section.

        Args:
            param1 (str): Description of `param1`.
            param2 (:obj:`int`, optional): Description of `param2`. Multiple
                lines are supported.
            param3 (:obj:`list` of :obj:`str`): Description of `param3`.
